            <p>Hi, my name is Cherie Lum. I'm a Software Developer living in Atlanta, GA.
                I'm originally from New York City, attended the University of Vermont where I majored in Sociology and minored in Business Administration.
                Upon graduation, I had many different jobs from being a wedding planner to working in a bank, but kept dabbling into coding during my free time.
                In the summer of 2017 I moved from NY to GA, built the courage to quit my job, and focus fully on coding.
            </p>
